# reads.news
### a private aggregator for people with too much news to read

The idea is to have a personal "news page" which will be a subdomain of reads.news, for example: https://chris.reads.news, which others (or yourself) can post to by sending links to the same e-mail address (chris@reads.news). It's probably a bad idea, and definitely not secure/compliant with privacy laws, but it's fun so that's all that really counts.
